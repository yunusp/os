// the same data.
//

#define MSG_PEEK 0x00000001

//
// Requests out-of-band data. The significance and semantics of out-of-band
// data are protocol-specific. This flag is also returned by the kernel when
// out-of-band data is received.
//

#define MSG_OOB 0x00000002

//
// On SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that the function block until the full
// amount of data can be returned. The function may return the smaller amount
// of data if the socket is a message-based socket, if a signal is caught, if
// the connection is terminated, is MSG_PEEK was specified, or if an error is
// pending for the socket.
//

#define MSG_WAITALL 0x00000004

//
// This flag indicates a complete message, used by sequential packet sockets.
// This flag can be set by user-mode on transmit and kernel-mode on receive.
//

#define MSG_EOR 0x00000008

//
// This flag is returned by the kernel when the trailing portion of the
// datagram was discarded because the datagram was larger than the buffer
// supplied.
//

#define MSG_TRUNC 0x00000010

//
// This flag is returned by the kernel when some control/ancillary data is
// discarded due to lack of space in the provided ancillary buffer.
//

#define MSG_CTRUNC 0x00000020

//
// This flag requests not to send a broken pipe signal on stream oriented

#define MSG_NOSIGNAL 0x00000040

//
// This flag requests that the operation not block.
//

#define MSG_DONTWAIT 0x00000080

//
// This flag requests that routing tables not be used when sending a packet.
// This limits the system to sending the packet across networks that are
// directly connected.
//

#define MSG_DONTROUTE 0x00000100

//

// Define socket options.
//

//
// This options reports whether or not socket listening is enabled. The option
// value is an int boolean and is read only.
//

#define SO_ACCEPTCONN 1

//
// This option permits the sending of broadcast messages, if supported by the
// protocol. The option value is an int boolean.
//

#define SO_BROADCAST 2

//
// This option turns on recording of debugging information in the protocol. The
// option value is an int boolean.
//

#define SO_DEBUG 3

//
// This option requests that outgoing messages bypass the standard routing
// facilities. The destination shall assumed to be directly connected, and
// messages are directed to the appropriate network interface based on the
// destination address. The affect, if any, depends on what protocl is in use.
// This option takes an int boolean value.
//

#define SO_DONTROUTE 4

//
// This option reports information about the error status and clears it. The
// option value is an int.
//

#define SO_ERROR 5

//
// This option keeps connections active by enabling the periodic transmission
// of messages, if supported by the protocol. This option takes an int boolean.
// If the connected socket fails to respond to these messages, the connection
// is broken and threads writing to the socket are notified with a SIGPIPE
// signal.
//

#define SO_KEEPALIVE 6

//
// This option lingers on a close function if data is present. This option
// controls the action taken when unsent messages queue on a socket and close
// is performed. If this option is set, the system blocks the calling thread
// during close until it can transmit the data or until the time expires. If
// this option is not set and close is called, the system handles the call in
// a way that allows the calling thread to continue as quickly as possible. The
// option takes a linger structure to specify the state of the option and
// linger interval.
//

#define SO_LINGER 7

//
// This option leaves out-of-band data (data marked urgent) inline. The option
// value is an integer boolean.
//

#define SO_OOBINLINE 8

//
// This option sets the receive buffer size. It taks an int value.
//

#define SO_RCVBUF 9

//
// This option sets the minimum number of bytes to process for socket input
// operations. The default value is 1 byte. If this is set to a larger value,
// blocking receive calls normally wait until they have received the smaller of
// the low water mark or the requested amount. They may return less than the
// low water mark if an error or signal occurs. This option takes an int value.
//

#define SO_RCVLOWAT 10

//
// This option sets the maximum amount of time an input function waits until it
// completes. The value is a timeval structure specifying how long to wait
// before returning with whatever data was collected, if any. The default value
// is zero, meaning the receive operation does not time out.
//

#define SO_RCVTIMEO 11

//
// This option sets the send buffer size. It takes an int value.
//

#define SO_SNDBUF 12

//
// This option sets the minimum number of bytes to process for socket output
// operations. Non-blocking output operations shall process no data if flow
// control does not allow the smaller of the send low water mark value or the
// entire request to be processed. This option takes an int value.
//

#define SO_SNDLOWAT 13

//
// This option sets maximum amount of time an output function would block
// because flow control is preventing data from being sent. If a send operation
// has blocked for this time, it shall return with a partial count or 0 if no
// data was sent. The default value is 0, indicating that send operations do
// not time out. This option takes a timeval structure.
//

#define SO_SNDTIMEO 14

//
// This option reports the socket type. The value is an int.
//

#define SO_TYPE 15

//
// Despite its name, when enabled, this option allows the socket to bind to
// the same local port as an existing socket as long as one of them is bound to
// the any address and the other is bound to a different local address (i.e.
// they cannot both be bound to the any address). Additionally, this option
// allows the socket to bind to the exact same local address and port as an
// existing socket if the existing socket is in the time-wait state. Both
// sockets must have this option set for it to take effect. This option takes
// an int boolean.
//

#define SO_REUSEADDR 16

//
// This option allows a socket to bind to the exact same local address and
// port as an existing socket. Both sockets must have the option set for it to
// take effect. This option takes an int boolean.
//

#define SO_REUSEPORT 17

//
// This option determines whether or not to send and receive credentials
// automatically in the control data. This only applies to local sockets.
//

#define SO_PASSCRED 18

//
// This option returns the credentials of the foreign socket at the time of
// connect. This only applies to local sockets. The argument is a pointer to
// a ucred structure.
//

#define SO_PEERCRED 19

//
// Define the level number for the get/setsockopts function to apply to the
// socket itself.
//

#define SOL_SOCKET 0xFFFF

//
// Define socket ioctl numbers.
//

//
// This ioctl returns a non-zero integer if the inbound data stream is at the
// urgent mark. If the SO_OOBINLINE option is not and SIOCATMARK returns true,
// then the next read from the socket will return the bytes following the
// urgent data. Note that a read never reads across the urgent mark.
//

#define SIOCATMARK 0x7300

//
// This ioctl returns the amount of unread data in the receive buffer for
// stream sockets.
//

#define SIOCINQ FIONREAD

//
// Define the maximum length of the connection backlog queue for listen calls
// before the system stats refusing connection requests.

        appropriate members to valid buffers if the remote network address or
        ancillary data is desired.

    Flags - Supplies a bitfield of flags governing the reception of the data.
        See MSG_* definitions.

Return Value:

    Returns the number of bytes received on success.

    -1 on error, and the errno variable will be set to contain more information.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine shuts down all or part of a full-duplex socket connection.

Arguments:

    Socket - Supplies the socket to shut down.

    How - Supplies the type of shutdown. Valid values are SHUT_RD to disable
        further receive operations, SHUT_WR to disable further send operations,
        or SHUT_RDWR to disable further send and receive operations.

Return Value:

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine sets a socket option for the given socket.

Arguments:

    Socket - Supplies the file descriptor of the socket to set options for.

    Level - Supplies the protocol level at which the option resides. To set
        options at the socket level, supply SOL_SOCKET. To set options at other
        levels, specify the identifier for the protocol controlling the option.
        For example, to indicate that an option is interpreted by the TCP
        protocol, set this parameter to IPPROTO_TCP.

    OptionName - Supplies the option name that is passed to the protocol module
        for interpretation. See SO_* definitions.

    OptionValue - Supplies a pointer to a buffer that is passed uninterpreted
        to the protocol module. The contents of the buffer are option-specific.

    OptionLength - Supplies the length of the option buffer in bytes.

Return Value:

    0 on success.

    -1 on failure, and errno will be set to contain more information.

Routine Description:

    This routine retrieves the current value of a given socket option.

Arguments:

    Socket - Supplies the file descriptor of the socket.

    Level - Supplies the protocol level at which the option resides. To get
        options at the socket level, supply SOL_SOCKET. To get options at other
        levels, specify the identifier for the protocol controlling the option.
        For example, to indicate that an option is interpreted by the TCP
        protocol, set this parameter to IPPROTO_TCP.

    OptionName - Supplies the option name that is passed to the protocol module
        for interpretation. See SO_* definitions.

    OptionValue - Supplies a pointer to a buffer where the option value is
        returned on success.

    OptionLength - Supplies a pointer that on input contains the size of the
        option value buffer in bytes. If the supplied length is less than the
        actual size of the option value, then the option value will be silently
        truncated. On output, if the supplied length is greater than the actual
        size of the value, this will contain the actual size of the value.

Return Value:

    0 on success.

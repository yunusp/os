        "name=value". This string will become part of the environment, if it
        is modified then that modification will be reflected in the
        environment. The memory supplied in this argument is used directly, so
        the argument must not be automatically allocated. If the given string
        contains no equal sign, then the functionality is equivalent to

        compare elements. The function takes in two pointers that will point
        to elements within the array. It shall return less than zero if the
        left element is considered less than the right object, zero if the left
        object is considered equal to the right object, and greater than zero
        if the left object is considered greater than the right object.

Arguments:

    ArrayBase - Supplies a pointer to the array of items that will get pushed
        around.

    ElementCount - Supplies the number of elements in the array.

    ElementSize - Supplies the size of one of the elements.

    CompareFunction - Supplies a pointer to a function that will be used to

    StringAfterScan - Supplies a pointer where a pointer will be returned
        representing the remaining portion of the string after the integer was
        scanned. If the entire string is made up of whitespace or invalid
        characters, then this will point to the beginning of the given string
        (the scanner will not be advanced).

    Base - Supplies the base system to interpret the number as. If zero is
        supplied, the base will be figured out based on the contents of the
        string. If the string begins with 0, it's treated as an octal (base 8)
        number. If the string begins with 1-9, it's treated as a decimal
        (base 10) number. And if the string begins with 0x or 0X, it's treated
        as a hexadecimal (base 16) number. Other base values must be specified
        explicitly here.

Return Value:

    Returns the integer representation of the string. If the value could not be
    converted, 0 is returned, and errno will be set to EINVAL to indicate the
    number could not be converted.

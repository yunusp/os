#define PTHREAD_API LIBC_API

//
// Define mutex types.
//

//
// This type of mutex does not detect deadlock.
//

#define PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL 0

//
// This type of mutex provides error checking. A thread attempting to relock
// this mutex without first unlocking fails. A thread attempting to unlock a
// mutex that another thread has locked will also fail.
//

#define PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK 1

//
// This type of mutex allows a thread to succeed a call to acquire the mutex
// after already acquiring the mutex. A count will be maintained of acquire
// counts for the owning thread, and the mutex will only be released to other
// threads when the acquire count drops to zero.

//
// This type is the default type for an initialized mutex.
//

#define PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL

//
// This value indicates an object such as a mutex is private to the process.

//
// This value indicates an object such as a mutex is shared across all
// processes.
//

#define PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED 1

//
// This (default) value indicates that use of the thread ID as a parameter to
// the thread join or detach routines is permitted.
//

#define PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE 0

//
// This value indicates that the use of the thread ID in the join or detach
// routines is prohibited, as the thread may exit and the ID may be reused at
// any time.
//

#define PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED 1

//
// This value indicates that created threads contend with all other threads
// in the system for CPU resources.
//

#define PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM 0

//
// This value indicates that created threads only contend with other threads
// in their parent process for CPU resources. This is not currently supported.
//

#define PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS 1

//
// This value indicates that thread cancellation is enabled: thread can be
// canceled.
//

#define PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE 0

//
// This value indicates that thread cancellation is currently disabled.
//

#define PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE 1

//
// This value indicates that thread cancellation requests will be deferred
// until the next cancellation point.
//

#define PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED 0

//
// This value indicates that thread cancellation requests will be processed
// immediately.
//

#define PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS 1

//
// This thread return value indicates that the thread was canceled, rather than
// returning naturally.

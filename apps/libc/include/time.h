Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about an interval timer.

Members:

    it_interval - Stores the period of the timer for periodic timers, or 0.0 if
        the timer is a one-shot timer.

    it_value - Stores the due time of the timer.

Structure Description:

    This structure describes the C library concept of calendar time.

Members:

    tm_sec - Stores the second. Valid values are between 0 and 60 (for leap
        seconds).

    tm_min - Stores the minute. Valid values are between 0 and 59.

    tm_hour - Stores the hour. Valid values are between 0 and 23.

    tm_mday - Stores the day of the month. Valid values are between 1 and 31.

    tm_mon - Stores the month. Valid values are between 0 and 11.

    tm_year - Stores the number of years since 1900. Valid values are between
        -1899 and 8099 (for actual calendar years between 1 and 9999).

    tm_wday - Stores the day of the week. Valid values are between 0 and 6,
        with 0 being Sunday and 6 being Saturday.

    tm_yday - Stores the day of the year. Valid values are between 0 and 365.

    tm_isdst - Stores a value indicating if the given time is represented in
        daylight saving time. Usually 0 indicates standard time, 1 indicates
        daylight saving time, and -1 indicates "unknown".

    tm_nanosecond - Stores the nanosecond. Valid values are between 0 and
        999,999,999.

    tm_gmtoff - Stores the offset from Greenwich Mean Time in seconds that
        this time is interpreted in.

        name. The user should not modify or free this buffer.

             structure is negative, no characters are returned.
        %Z - Replaced by the timezone name or abbreviation, or by no bytes if
             no timezone information exists.

Routine Description:

    This routine returns the overrun count for the given timer. The overrun
    count can be queried during a signal, and represents the number of
    additional timer expiries that occurred before the signal was accepted by
    the process. If added to the count of signals that have occurred it
    represents the total number of expiries of the given periodic timer.

Arguments:

    TimerId - Supplies the timer to query.

Return Value:

    Returns the overrun count on success.

Routine Description:

    This routine suspends execution of the calling thread until either the
    given requested time elapses or a signal was delivered. If a signal was
    delivered, then the time remaining in the interval is reported.

Arguments:

    RequestedTime - Supplies a pointer to the requested interval wait time.

    RemainingTime - Supplies an optional pointer that receives the time
        remaining in the interval if the routine is interrupted by a signal.

Return Value:

    0 on success.

    -1 on failure, and errno will be set to contain more information.

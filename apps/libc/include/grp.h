Structure Description:

    This structure defines the group structure which contains information about
    a security group.

Members:

    gr_name - Stores a pointer to a null terminated string containing the name
        of the group.

    gr_passwd - Stores a pointer to the null terminated encrypted group
        password string (an obscure feature).

    gr_gid - Stores the numerical group ID.

    gr_mem - Stores a pointer to an array of character pointers to group member
        names. The array is null terminated.

Routine Description:

    This routine searches the group database for a group matching the given
    name, and returns information about that group. This routine is neither
    reentrant nor thread safe.

Arguments:

    GroupName - Supplies a pointer to the null terminated string containing the
        group name to search for.

Return Value:

    Returns a pointer to the group information on success. This buffer may be
    overwritten by subsequent calls to getgrent, getgrgid, or getgrnam.

    NULL on failure or if the given group was not found. On failure, errno will
    be set to provide more information.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine searches the group database for a group matching the given
    name, and returns information about that group. This routine is reentrant
    and thread safe.

Arguments:

    GroupName - Supplies a pointer to the null terminated string containing the
        group name to search for.

    GroupInformation - Supplies a pointer where the group information will be
        returned.

    Buffer - Supplies a buffer used to allocate strings that the group
        information points to out of. The maximum size needed for this buffer
        can be determined with the _SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX sysconf parameter.

    BufferSize - Supplies the size of the supplied buffer in bytes.

    Result - Supplies a pointer where a pointer to the group information
        parameter will be returned on success, or NULL will be returned if the
        specified group could not be found.

Return Value:

    0 on success.

    Returns an error value on failure.

Routine Description:

    This routine searches the group database for a group matching the given ID.
    This routine is neither reentrant nor thread safe.

Arguments:

    GroupId - Supplies the ID of the group to search for.

Return Value:

    Returns a pointer to the group information structure on success. This
    buffer may be overwritten by subsequent calls to this routine.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine searches the group database for a group matching the given ID.
    This routine is both reentrant and thread safe.

Arguments:

    GroupId - Supplies the ID of the group to search for.

    Group - Supplies a pointer where the group information will be returned.
        All pointers to buffers returned will point inside the passed in buffer.

    Buffer - Supplies a pointer to a buffer to use for additional group
        information. This buffer is used to return things like the group name
        and members array. The maximum size needed for this buffer can be
        determined with the _SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX sysconf parameter.

    BufferSize - Supplies the size of the supplied buffer in bytes.

    ResultPointer - Supplies a pointer where the group parameter pointer will
        be returned on success. If no group matching the given ID was found,
        NULL will be returned here.

Return Value:

    0 on success.

    Returns an error value on failure.

struct group *
getgrent (

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine returns a pointer to a structure containing the broken out
    fields of an entry in the group database. Subsequent calls to this function
    return the next successive entries in the group database, so this routine
    can be called repeatedly to iterate over the entire group database. This
    routine is neither thread-safe nor reentrant.

Arguments:

    None.

Return Value:

    Returns a pointer to the first group entry upon the first call. The buffer
    returned may be overwritten by subsequent calls to this routine. The
    memory returned here must not be modified or freed by the caller.

    Returns pointers to successive group entries in the group database on
    additional calls.

    NULL if no more entries exist or an error occurred. The errno variable will
    be set to contain more information if an error occurred.

Routine Description:

    This routine returns a pointer to the broken out fields of the next entry

        returned on success.

    Buffer - Supplies a pointer to the buffer where strings will be stored.

    BufferSize - Supplies the size of the given buffer in bytes.

    ReturnPointer - Supplies a pointer to a pointer to a group information
        structure. On success, the information pointer parameter will be
        returned here.

Return Value:

    0 on success.

    ENOENT if there are no more entries.

    Returns an error number on failure.

Arguments:

    UserName - Supplies a pointer to a string containing the user name of the
        user whose groups are desired.

    GroupId - Supplies a group ID that if not in the list of groups the given
        user belongs to will also be included in the return returns. Typically
        this argument is specified as the group ID from the password record
        for the given user.

    Groups - Supplies an array where the membership groups of the given user
        will be returned.

    GroupCount - Supplies a pointer that on input contains the maximum number
        of elements can can be stored in the supplied groups buffer. On
        output, contains the number of groups found for the user, even if this
        is greater than the number of groups supplied.

Return Value:

    Returns the number of groups the user belongs to on success.

    the buffer passed in. In this case the group count parameter will contain
    the correct number.

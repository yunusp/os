VMWare should work pretty well out of the box. I'm using a guest OS type of
Other, Other, but this shouldn't be required. I'm also using SATA (AHCI) as a
storage type, though IDE should work just as well.

Mouse Support
To get the mouse up and running, add a USB 2.0 controller in the VMWare
settings. Then in the .vmx file, add the following to enable the USB mouse:

mouse.vusb.enable = "TRUE"

Sound Support
You'll need to enable the Intel HD audio virtual device in the guest. Add the
following to your .vmx file:

sound.virtualDev = "hdaudio"

        for definitions.

    PacketSizeInformation - Stores the packet size information bound by the
        protocol, network and link layers if the socket is locally bound. For
        unbound sockets, this stores the size information limited by only the
        protocol and network layers.

    UnboundPacketSizeInformation - Stores the packet size information bound by
        only the protocol and network layers.

    LastError - Stores the last error encountered by this socket.

    Link - Stores a pointer to the link this socket is associated with.

    LinkAddress - Stores the link address information for the given socket.

    SendPacketCount - Stores the number of packets sent on this socket.

    MaxIncomingConnections - Stores the maximum number of pending but not yet
        accepted connections that are allowed to accumulate before connections
        are refused. In the sockets API this is known as the backlog count.

    HopLimit - Stores the hop limit (a.k.a. time-to-live) that is to be set in
        the IP headers of every packet sent by this socket.

    DifferentiatedServicesCodePoint - Stores the differentiated services code
        point that is to be set in the IP header of every packet sent by this
        socket.

    MulticastHopLimit - Stores the hop limit (a.k.a. time-to-live) that is to
        be set in the IP header of every multicast packet sent by this socket.

    MulticastInterface - Stores the interface over which to send all multicast
        packets. If this is not initialized, then a default interface is chosen
        just as it would be for unicast packets.

    MulticastLock - Supplies a pointer to the queued lock that protects access
        to the multicast information.

    MulticastGroupList - Stores the head of the list of multicast groups to
        which the socket belongs.

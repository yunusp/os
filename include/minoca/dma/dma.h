Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about a DMA controller.

Members:

    Version - Stores the version number of this table. This is set to
        DMA_INFORMATION_VERSION.

    ControllerUuid - Stores a universally unique identifier that identifies the
        manufacturer and model of the DMA controller. This specifies the format
        of the controller-specific configuration information.

    ControllerRevision - Stores the minor revision information for the DMA
        controller. Changes in these revisions are not significant enough to
        change the configuration and information structures.

    Capabilities - Stores a bitmask of DMA controller capabilities. See
        DMA_CAPABILITY_* for definnitions.

    ExtendedInfo - Stores a pointer to controller-specific extended information,
        the format of which depends on the UUID.

    ExtendedInfoSize - Stores the size of the extended information in bytes.

    ChannelCount - Stores the number of channels in the controller.

    MinAddress - Stores the lowest physical address (inclusive) that the DMA
        controller can access.

    MaxAddress - Stores the highest physical address (inclusive) that the DMA
        controller can access.

/*++

Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about a single DMA transfer request.

Members:

    ListEntry - Stores a list entry used internally by the DMA library. Users
        should ignore this member.

    Allocation - Stores a pointer to the resource allocation describing the
        channel, request line, and a few other standardized DMA configuration
        details.

    Configuration - Stores a pointer to the controller-specific DMA channel
        configuration for this transfer. This memory should remain valid for
        the duration of the transfer.

    ConfigurationSize - Stores the size of configuration data in bytes.

    Direction - Stores the transfer direction. For memory to memory transfers,
        the transfer always goes from the "memory" member to the
        "device memory" member.

    Memory - Stores a pointer to the memory side of the transfer. This is the
        non-device side. This must be a non-paged I/O buffer.

    Device - Stores a pointer to the device side of the transfer, or the
        destination for memory to memory transfers.

    CompletionCallback - Stores a pointer to the routine to call when the
        transfer is complete. This callback will occur at dispatch level.

    UserContext - Stores a pointer's worth of context information that is
        unused by the DMA library or host controller. The user can store
        context here.

    Size - Stores the size of the transfer in bytes. It is an error if this
        size does not translate evenly to bus sized transactions. This size may
        be truncated after submission if there weren't enough internal DMA
        descriptors to accommodate the full size.

    Width - Stores the width of the transfer, in bytes. Supply 0 to use the
        width from the resource allocation.

    Flags - Stores a bitfield of flags governing the transfer. See
        DMA_TRANSFER_* definitions.

    Completed - Stores the number of bytes successfully transferred. For
        continous transfers, this represents the current offset within the
        transfer at which the DMA is operating at the time of the interrupt.

    Status - Stores the final status code of the transfer, as returned by the
        DMA controller.

    InterruptPeriod - Stores the number of bytes after which a continuous DMA
        transfer will interrupt. If this is zero, the continuous transfer will
        interrupt after 'Size' bytes have been transferred.

Routine Description:

    This routine returns information about a given DMA controller.

Arguments:

    Interface - Supplies a pointer to the interface instance, used to identify
        which specific controller is being queried.

    Information - Supplies a pointer where the DMA controller information is
        returned on success. The caller should initialize the version number of

Routine Description:

    This routine submits a transfer to the DMA controller for execution. This
    routine will ensure that other devices do not perform transfers on the
    given channel while this transfer is in progress. The submission is
    asynchronous, this routine will return immediately, and the callback
    function will be called when the transfer is complete.

Arguments:

    Interface - Supplies a pointer to the DMA controller interface.

    Transfer - Supplies a pointer to the transfer to execute.

Return Value:

    Status code. This routine will return immediately, the transfer will not
    have been complete. The caller should utilize the callback function to get
    notified when a transfer has completed.

Arguments:

    Interface - Supplies a pointer to the DMA controller interface.

    Transfer - Supplies a pointer to the transfer to cancel.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS if the transfer was successfully canceled.

    STATUS_TOO_LATE if the transfer is already complete.

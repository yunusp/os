Module Name:

    ElfConv

Abstract:

    This module builds the ElfConv utility, which converts an ELF image
    into a PE image. UEFI exclusively loads PE images, which is why the
    conversion is necessary. With certain restrictions (such as the lack
    of dynamic libraries) conversion is doable, though not a lot of fun.
